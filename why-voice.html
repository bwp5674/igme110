          </h1>

          <p>
            Before getting into voice applications, let’s take a look at how the
            smartphone impacted the internet as we know it. Suddenly, a desktop
            computer or laptop was no longer necessary as most things could be
            done with the devices in our pockets, especially with the
            introduction of mobile-friendly websites and more importantly: apps.
            All of a sudden, there was an app for everything. Indie developers
            were making millions of dollars because they were one of the first
            to create a mobile app for something. Many ideas had already existed
            within the ecosystem of the internet, but were not adapted for
            smartphones.

            Fast forward to today, a lot of concepts are being thrown around in
            anticipation for the next groundbreaking interface: VR, AR,
            blockchain, cloud computing, and IoT to name a few. While voice-user
            interfaces isn’t exactly a household phrase, the applications are
            spreading like wildfire. What are they? “Voice user interfaces
            (VUIs) allow the user to interact with a system through voice or
            speech commands”. Think of Siri, Alexa, and the Google Assistant.
            Technology giants are investing billions into their voice
            ecosystems:

          <ul>
            <li>
              This January, Amazon announced that they have sold 100 million
              Alexa devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Google announced that the Google Assistant would be installed on
              one billion devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Spotify, and Samsung are hard at
              work at creating their own voice assistants, as well as creating
              “smart-speakers” with their assistants installed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Amazon was practically giving away Echo Dots like candy last Black
              Friday in order to get more users on their new platform.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Voice interfaces will not only impact consumers, however. It can be
            argued that applications for voice interfaces lie in almost every
            industry, just as the internet and IoT devices changed jobs in
            almost every field.

            Right now, there are some obstacles preventing a voice interfaces
            from being these game-changing platforms. As developers, we have the
            ability to accelerate this process by building “voice-optimized”
            apps for these assistants. There is currently a huge market for
            third-party, voice-first applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            While voice interfaces won’t be taking the place of smartphones any
            time soon, it is important to focus on creating mobile-optimized
            experiences when developing a smart assistant app (Alexa Skill or
            Google Assistant Action). Making your service simply run on a smart
            speaker will not cut it. Instead, build applications optimized for
            medium. As this occurs, the integration of voice assistants in
            consumers’ daily lives will become frictionless and your apps will
            succeed.
